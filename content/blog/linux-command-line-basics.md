## Introduction
The Linux operating system provides users with a powerful command-line interface for interacting with their systems. In this article, you'll learn the basics of the Linux command line and its essential components. Here's a summary of 10 commonly used Linux commands:

## 1. ls (List)
Used to display files and directories in a directory. For example, to list files in the current directory, you can use the following command:

```shell
ls 

```

## 2. grep (Global Regular Expression Print)
Allows you to search for a specific word or expression within text files and print the results to the screen. For example:

```shell
grep "search_term" file.txt

```
## 3. cd (Change Directory)
Used for navigating between directories. For instance, to go to the root directory, you can use:

```shell
cd / 
```

## 4. man (Manual)
Used to display documentation and usage of other commands. For example:

```shell

man ls 
```

## 5. exit

## 7. mkdir (Make Directory)

## 10. cat (Concatenate)
