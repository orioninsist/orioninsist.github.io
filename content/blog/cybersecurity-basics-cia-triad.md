### Introduction: Why is Cybersecurity Important?

In today's digital age, everything from our bank accounts to personal photos and health records is online. All this information is a potential target for cyber attackers. This is where cybersecurity comes in. So, what does it mean to keep a system or data secure? The answer lies in the **CIA Triad**, the most fundamental building block of cybersecurity.

### What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA triad is an acronym for the three core principles used to ensure information security: **C**onfidentiality, **I**ntegrity, and **A**vailability. Let's explore each concept.

#### 1. Confidentiality

Confidentiality is about preventing sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Just like a letter that only the recipient can open, confidentiality ensures that data is only viewable by authorized users.

* **Example:** Logging into your email account with a password; your bank account being private to you.
* **Violation Example:** A hacker stealing user passwords from a database.

#### 2. Integrity

Integrity is about preventing unauthorized or accidental modification, deletion, or corruption of data. It ensures that the data is accurate and trustworthy.

* **Example:** On an e-commerce site, your order is accurately listed with the correct products and order number.
* **Violation Example:** An attacker changing the amount of money in your bank account without your permission.

#### 3. Availability

Availability ensures that authorized users can access systems and data when needed. This includes a website being accessible 24/7 or a file being retrievable at any moment.

* **Example:** A website providing uninterrupted service around the clock.
* **Violation Example:** A website crashing due to a cyberattack (DDoS), preventing users from accessing it.

### Why is it So Important?

A cyberattack often targets one or more of these three principles. For example, an attack on a bank's database could violate **Confidentiality** by stealing customer information and **Integrity** by changing account balances.

The CIA triad acts as a guiding compass when designing a system or analyzing a security breach.
