## Computers and Components 
A computer is a device that processes data and follows instructions called programs. It includes hardware like the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices.

## Programs and Programming Languages 
- **Program**: A program is a set of commands that tells the computer what to do.
- **Programming Language**: A programming language helps developers give instructions to the computer in a standard way.

### Machine Language
- Computers are made of **transistors**, which can either stop or allow electricity to pass through.
- **0 (Low)** means no electricity passes, and **1 (High)** means electricity passes.
- Machine language is made up of 0s and 1s, which is the only language a computer can understand.
- Everything you see on a screen comes from these 0s and 1s.
- For example, "HELLO" in binary looks like:
    - H → 01001000
    - E → 01000101
    - L → 01001100
    - L → 01001100
    - O → 01001111
