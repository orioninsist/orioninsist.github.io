### Introduction
If you want to become a SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center Analyst), the very first step is to build a strong foundation in networking. Without understanding how networks work, it is almost impossible to detect attacks, analyze logs, or respond to incidents effectively.
In this article, we will explore why networking is crucial for SOC Analysts and which core concepts you should master first.
### Why Networking Matters for SOC Analysts
1. Every attack flows through the network.
2. Log analysis requires protocol knowledge.
3. Incident response is network-centric.
### Core Networking Concepts to Learn First
Here are the essential topics for every beginner SOC Analyst:
- OSI & TCP/IP Models ‚Üí Know how data travels across the layers.
- IP Addressing & Subnetting ‚Üí Understand how devices are identified and grouped.
- DNS, DHCP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP ‚Üí The protocols you will see daily in logs.
- Routing & Switching Basics ‚Üí How traffic moves between networks.
- Ports & Protocols ‚Üí Recognize what service is running (e.g., TCP 443 = HTTPS).
### Real-World Example
Imagine you see unusual outbound traffic on port 53 (DNS).
- A SOC Analyst with networking knowledge knows that DNS is normally used for resolving domain names.
- But if traffic looks encrypted and large in volume, it might indicate DNS tunneling (a method attackers use to exfiltrate data).
üëâ Without networking fundamentals, you would miss this red flag.
