## Introduction
In this video tutorial, we'll explore how to establish a basic client-server communication using Python. We'll be using the socket module to create a TCP/IP socket and exchange messages between a client and a server. The client will send messages to the server, and the server will respond with a confirmation message. Let's dive into the code and see how it works!

## Code
Let's take a look at the code snippets for the client and server.

## Client-side code (client.py)

```python
import socket

host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 50001

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((host, port))

message = input(">> ")

while message.lower().strip() != "quit":
    client_socket.send(message.encode())
    data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    print("Response from Server: " + str(data))
    message = input(">> ")

client_socket.close()
```

## Server-side code (server.py):

```python
import socket

host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 50001

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((host, port))
server_socket.listen()

conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
print("Connected from: " + str(addr))

while True:
    data = conn.recv(1024).decode()
    print(data)
    response_data = "Message Received"
    conn.send(response_data.encode())

conn.close()
```

## Explanation
The client-side code establishes a connection to the server by creating a socket and connecting to the specified host and port. It then prompts the user for input and sends the message to the server. The server-side code listens for incoming connections, accepts the client's connection, and receives messages from the client. It prints the received message and sends a confirmation response back to the client.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of client-server communication in Python. By using the socket module, we can establish a connection between a client and a server, allowing them to exchange data. This simple example serves as a foundation for more complex network applications. Feel free to explore further and build upon this knowledge.
