**Sharing my step-by-step process, technical notes, and lessons learned while training to become a Junior Security Analyst on TryHackMe.**

Cybersecurity is a vast ocean that requires constant learning. The best way to navigate this ocean without getting lost is to set a course and reinforce what you learn by explaining it to others (The Feynman Technique). This article series will serve as my logbook on the road to becoming a **Junior Security Analyst**.

My goal is clear: To enter the industry as a **SOC (Security Operations Center) Tier 1** analyst.

In this series, I will share the notes I take, the labs I solve, and the technical challenges I encounter during my "Junior Security Analyst" training journey on **TryHackMe**, filtered through my own perspective.

***

### Why SOC Tier 1?

Known as the frontline of cyber defense, the SOC is the center that monitors, analyzes, and defends an organization's digital security. The Tier 1 analyst is the "eyes" of this center.

When an attack occurs, the Tier 1 analyst is the person who sees the first alarm and distinguishes whether it is a real threat or a false alarm (False Positive). This role forms the cornerstone of a cybersecurity career because it teaches:

*   **Log Analysis:** Understanding the language of systems.
*   **Incident Response:** Remaining calm during a crisis.
*   **Tool Mastery:** Using industry-standard tools like SIEM, EDR, and IDS.

### What Will You Find in This Series?

I know that on Medium, "copy-paste" content is less valuable than truly digested information. Therefore, my notes here will not be literal translations of the training text. Instead, you will see how I approach events as an aspiring analyst.

In future articles, we will dive deep into the following topics:

1.  **Traffic Analysis:** How do we detect anomalies hidden inside network packets?
2.  **Log Review:** How do we track an attacker's footprints in web server logs?
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** How are system flaws found before they are exploited?
4.  **Case Studies:** Threat Hunting based on real-world scenarios.

### My Roadmap and Methodology

My main resource on this journey will be the guided training paths on **TryHackMe**. However, I will not stay only in theory; I will translate what I learn into practical scenarios.

For example; instead of just theoretically defining an `SQL Injection` attack, we will discuss how we should take action when we see a `UNION SELECT` statement in the logs. My aim is not to memorize, but to develop an analyst mindset.

### Conclusion

If you aim to build a career in cybersecurity or are curious about the development process of a **Junior Security Analyst**, this series can be a guide for you.

In my next article, we will introduce the fundamentals of the defense line and the critical concepts an analyst needs to know.

Stay tuned and stay safe!
