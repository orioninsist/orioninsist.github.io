      <description>We are excited to announce the release of a new Python-based &ldquo;Random Password Generator.&rdquo; This project aims to provide users with a simple and secure way to generate random passwords.
Key Features Random and secure: The password generator utilizes the random and string modules in Python to create passwords that are both random and secure. Customizable length: Users can specify the desired length of the generated password, allowing flexibility based on their requirements. Easy to use: With a straightforward user interface, generating passwords is just a matter of running the script and providing the desired length.
