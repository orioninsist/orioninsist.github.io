      <description>Introduction In this video tutorial, we&rsquo;ll explore how to establish a basic client-server communication using Python. We&rsquo;ll be using the socket module to create a TCP/IP socket and exchange messages between a client and a server. The client will send messages to the server, and the server will respond with a confirmation message. Let&rsquo;s dive into the code and see how it works!
Code Let&rsquo;s take a look at the code snippets for the client and server.

      <description>Introduction The client-server architecture is a commonly used model in many network-based applications. In this model, a client connects to and communicates with a server. The client sends a message to the server, which processes it and then sends a response back to the client. Python&rsquo;s socket module is a powerful tool for creating such client-server applications. In this blog post, we will show you how to build a basic client-server chat application.
