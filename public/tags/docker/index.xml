      <description>Docker has become a cornerstone of modern application development. By containerizing applications, Docker streamlines deployment, simplifies collaboration, and promotes portability. This blog post delves into some fundamental Docker commands you&rsquo;ll encounter frequently.
Listing Docker Containers sudo docker container ls -a --no-trunc List all containers (including exited ones) without truncating names sudo docker container ls -a --no-trunc sudo docker container ls -a List all containers (running and stopped) sudo docker container ls -a sudo docker container ls -a -q List only container IDs sudo docker container ls -a -q sudo docker container ls -l List containers with detailed information sudo docker container ls -l sudo docker container ls -a --filter &#34;&#34; List containers based on filters (example: &ndash;filter status=running) sudo docker container ls -a --filter &#34;&#34; Running a Container sudo docker container run centos:7 ping 127.0.0.1 -c 10 Run a single instance of centos:7 image and execute ping command sudo docker container run centos:7 ping 127.0.0.1 -c 10 Viewing Container Information sudo docker ps List all running containers sudo docker ps sudo docker ps -a List all containers (running and stopped) with ps sudo docker ps -a Starting and Stopping Containers sudo docker container run -d centos:7 ping 127.0.0.1 Run a container in detached mode (background) sudo docker container run -d centos:7 ping 127.0.0.1 sudo docker ps Verify the container is running (after running in detached mode) sudo docker ps Inspecting Container Logs sudo docker container logs [containerid] View logs of a specific container (replace [containerid] with actual ID) sudo docker container logs [containerid] sudo docker container logs --tail [containerid] View only the most recent logs of a container (replace [containerid] with actual ID) sudo docker container logs --tail [containerid] sudo docker container logs --tail 10 [containerid] sudo docker container logs -f [containerid] Follow container logs in real-time (replace [containerid] with actual ID) sudo docker container logs -f [containerid] Additional Commands sudo docker container start [containerid]: Starts a stopped container. sudo docker container stop [containerid]: Stops a running container. sudo docker container rm [containerid]: Removes a container. Conclusion This blog post provides a brief overview of essential Docker commands. By mastering these commands, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to effectively managing containers and building robust applications with Docker. Note: Replace [containerid] with the actual ID of the container whenever applicable in the commands.

      <description>Introduction Docker has revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed. It provides a lightweight and portable environment for running containers, which are self-contained instances of an application and its dependencies. Docker commands offer a powerful means to manage and interact with these containers.
Updating and Listing Container Images
The provided Bash commands demonstrate the process of updating and listing Docker container images.
sudo docker container run -it centos:7 bash sudo yum -y update ls -l This script first creates a new container based on the centos:7 image. Inside the container, it updates the system packages using the yum command. Finally, it lists the contents of the current directory.

      <description>Introduction Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies software development and deployment. It allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers ensure consistent performance across different environments.
Key Concepts Containers: Docker uses containers to encapsulate applications and dependencies, ensuring they run consistently.
Images: Docker containers are built from images, which are read-only templates containing everything needed to run an application.
Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a script used to create Docker images, specifying the application and its environment.
