      <description>Introduction Docker has revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed. It provides a lightweight and portable environment for running containers, which are self-contained instances of an application and its dependencies. Docker commands offer a powerful means to manage and interact with these containers.
Updating and Listing Container Images
The provided Bash commands demonstrate the process of updating and listing Docker container images.
sudo docker container run -it centos:7 bash sudo yum -y update ls -l This script first creates a new container based on the centos:7 image. Inside the container, it updates the system packages using the yum command. Finally, it lists the contents of the current directory.
