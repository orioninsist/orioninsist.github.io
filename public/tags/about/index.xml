      <description>About Hello there, I&rsquo;m Murat Kurkoglu, and I&rsquo;m the founder of orioninsist. With a background in both computer engineering and economics, I&rsquo;ve ventured into the world of technology and business. As a dedicated content creator, I wear the hats of a blogger and content producer, constantly curating fresh and engaging content.
My passion for innovation drives me to craft new content daily, ensuring that there&rsquo;s always something new and exciting to share. Beyond my roles as a computer engineer and economist, I find joy in the art of storytelling through words and visuals.
